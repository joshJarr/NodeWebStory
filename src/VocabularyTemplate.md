## What do other people think of your vocabulary?

Vocabulary tested in conjunction with my game (see game feedback)

Lok : Vocabulary works well with the theme, I like the first person idea.
Ed : Suits it's wide target audience
James : Like it; Simple so its not confusing
James : Works well with the first person view artwork
Dan : Supports the first person theme well, easy to read

From my feedback it is clear that the users wern't hinderd by the language used. It is difficult to focus much on language used as my language has two simple goals; to be as minimal as possible (fitting with the minimalistic design of the game) and to be first person, representing the idea of a user inside a dream.
